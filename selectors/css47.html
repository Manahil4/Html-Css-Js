<!-- selectors are name representation of html elements in css   -->
<!-- 
Simple selectors (e.g., element names, class names, ID selectors)
Combinator selectors (e.g., descendant selectors, child selectors, adjacent sibling selectors, general sibling selectors)
Attribute selectors (e.g., attribute existence, attribute value, attribute starts with, attribute ends with)
Pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover, :focus, :nth-child())
Pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before, ::after)
Functional pseudo-classes (e.g., :not(), :nth-of-type())
Structural pseudo-classes (e.g., :first-child, :last-child)

 <!-- 
 five categories of simple selectors in CSS:

1. **Element selectors:** These select elements based on their HTML tag names. For example:
   ```css
   p {
       /* Styles applied to all <p> elements */
   }
   ```

2. **Class selectors:** These select elements based on their class attribute. For example:
   ```css
   .btn {
       /* Styles applied to all elements with class="btn" */
   }
   ```

3. **ID selectors:** These select elements based on their ID attribute. Note that IDs should be unique within a document. For example:
   ```css
   #header {
       /* Styles applied to the element with id="header" */
   }
   ```

4. **Attribute selectors:** These select elements based on their attributes and attribute values. For example:
   ```css
   input[type="text"] {
       /* Styles applied to all <input> elements with type="text" */
   }
   ```

5. **Universal selector:** This selects all elements in the document. It's represented by an asterisk `*`. For example:
   ```css
   * {
       /* Styles applied to all elements */
   }
   ```

These are some of the fundamental simple selectors in CSS that allow you to target specific elements or groups of elements within a document.

  <!-- Grouping selectors are a way to apply styles to multiple elements without repeating the same style declarations for each individual selector. -->
  <style>
 
    h1, h2, h3 {
        color: blue;
        font-size: 24px;
    }    
  </style>
    <div class="box">

    </div>

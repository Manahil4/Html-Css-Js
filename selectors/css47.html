<!-- selectors are name representation of html elements in css   -->
<!-- 
Simple selectors (e.g., element names, class names, ID selectors)
Combinator selectors (e.g., descendant selectors, child selectors, adjacent sibling selectors, general sibling selectors)
Attribute selectors (e.g., attribute existence, attribute value, attribute starts with, attribute ends with)
Pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover, :focus, :nth-child())
Pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before, ::after)
Functional pseudo-classes (e.g., :not(), :nth-of-type())
Structural pseudo-classes (e.g., :first-child, :last-child)
 -->
 <!-- 
 five categories of simple selectors in CSS:

1. **Element selectors:** These select elements based on their HTML tag names. For example:
   ```css
   p {
       /* Styles applied to all <p> elements */
   }
   ```

2. **Class selectors:** These select elements based on their class attribute. For example:
   ```css
   .btn {
       /* Styles applied to all elements with class="btn" */
   }
   ```

3. **ID selectors:** These select elements based on their ID attribute. Note that IDs should be unique within a document. For example:
   ```css
   #header {
       /* Styles applied to the element with id="header" */
   }
   ```

4. **Attribute selectors:** These select elements based on their attributes and attribute values. For example:
   ```css
   input[type="text"] {
       /* Styles applied to all <input> elements with type="text" */
   }
   ```

5. **Universal selector:** This selects all elements in the document. It's represented by an asterisk `*`. For example:
   ```css
   * {
       /* Styles applied to all elements */
   }
   ```

These are some of the fundamental simple selectors in CSS that allow you to target specific elements or groups of elements within a document.
  -->
  <!-- Grouping selectors are a way to apply styles to multiple elements without repeating the same style declarations for each individual selector. -->
  <!-- Combinator selectors in CSS are used to specify relationships between different elements. Here are the types of combinator selectors:

1. Descendant Selector: It selects an element that is a descendant of another specified element.
   Example: `div p` selects all `<p>` elements that are descendants of `<div>` elements.

2. Child Selector: It selects an element that is a direct child of another specified element.
   Example: `div > p` selects all `<p>` elements that are immediate children of `<div>` elements.

3. Adjacent Sibling Selector: It selects an element that is immediately preceded by a specified sibling element.
   Example: `h2 + p` selects the `<p>` element that is immediately preceded by an `<h2>` element.

4. General Sibling Selector: It selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element and share the same parent.
   Example: `h2 ~ p` selects all `<p>` elements that are siblings of an `<h2>` element and share the same parent.

These combinator selectors provide flexibility in targeting specific elements based on their relationships with other elements in the HTML structure. -->
<!-- types of attribute selectors:

Attribute Existence Selector: Selects elements that have the specified attribute, regardless of its value.
Syntax: [attribute]

Attribute Value Selector: Selects elements with the specified attribute and value.
Syntax: [attribute="value"] -->
